<ol style="color:blue;">
  <li>Let A be the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. Write a program to find the ordered pairs are in the relation<br/>
 I) R1 = {(a, b) | a divides b} <br/>II) R2 = {(a, b) | a ≤ b}.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Suppose that A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2}. Let R be the relation from A to B containing (a, b) if a∈A, b∈B, and a > b. Write a program to find the relation R and also represent this relation in matrix form if a1 = 1, a2 = 2, and a3 = 3, and b1 = 1 and b2 = 2.</li>
